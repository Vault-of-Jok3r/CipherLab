üîê Cryptography - The Ultimate Python Encryption Toolkit
Cryptography is a terminal-based toolkit for file encryption and decryption. It provides multiple symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES, Blowfish, ARC2, XOR, and more. This modular structure makes it easy to extend or integrate additional ciphers.

üìå Features
AES Encryption/Decryption - Secure and widely used industry-standard cipher.
Blowfish Encryption/Decryption - Fast and effective block cipher.
ARC2 Encryption/Decryption - Another symmetric block cipher option.
XOR Encryption/Decryption - Basic bitwise operation for simple obfuscation.
Fully Terminal-Based - Run the tool directly in any CLI environment.
Modular & Extensible - Easily add new ciphers or customize existing ones.
üöÄ Installation
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Vault-of-Jok3r/Cryptography.git
cd Cryptography
Install dependencies

This project mainly relies on Python‚Äôs pycryptodome or similar libraries.
If needed, install them using:
bash
Copier
Modifier
pip install pycryptodome
(Adjust the command above if your environment requires additional libraries.)
Run the main cryptography script

bash
Copier
Modifier
python main.py
üìú Usage Guide
When you run python main.py, you'll see a terminal menu prompting you to select an encryption or decryption method. Follow the on-screen instructions to:

Encrypt a file (e.g., AES, Blowfish, ARC2, XOR, etc.)
Decrypt a file using the corresponding cipher and key.
Exit the program when done.

Each cipher has a dedicated encode and decode script, and they are all managed by main.py, which acts as the central hub.

‚ö° Future Enhancements
Additional Ciphers: RSA, ECC, or other asymmetric methods.
Key Management Improvements: Securely handle and store keys.
Hashing & Integrity Checks: Integrate checksums or HMAC for data integrity.
Multi-Platform Installers: Provide easy installation scripts for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Networking Capabilities: Secure file transfer or key exchange over a network.
